# Configuration Notes:
# 
# 1. Server Port:
#    - Choose an available port for the web interface
#    - Default is 8081
#
# 2. Admin User:
#    - This user will be created automatically on first run
#    - Change the default password for security
#    - Additional users can be created through the web interface
#
# 3. Nodes:
#    - name: Unique identifier for the node
#    - environment: Logical grouping (production, staging, development, etc.)
#    - host: IP address or hostname of the Supervisor instance
#    - port: Supervisor XML-RPC port (usually 9001)
#    - username/password: Supervisor authentication credentials
#
# 4. Supervisor Setup:
#    - Ensure Supervisor XML-RPC interface is enabled
#    - Add this to your supervisord.conf:
#    
#    [inet_http_server]
#    port=*:9001
#    username=supervisor
#    password=supervisor123
#
# 5. Security:
#    - Use strong passwords
#    - Consider using HTTPS in production
#    - Restrict network access to Supervisor ports
